# Mechanical Design Outline

1. **Identify Mechanical Components:** Determine the mechanical components that your hardware will require. This could include enclosures, mounts, gears, levers, etc.

2. **Design the Components:** Use your CAD software to design each component. Make sure to consider factors like material, strength, weight, and cost.

3. **Assembly:** Consider how the components will fit together. You may need to design additional parts like screws, clips, or hinges to assemble the components.

4. **Integration with Electronics:** If your hardware includes electronic components, make sure to design the mechanical components to accommodate them. This could involve designing mounts for PCBs, openings for connectors, or enclosures to protect sensitive components.

5. **Prototyping:** Use a 3D printer or other rapid prototyping method to create a physical prototype of your design. This will allow you to test the fit and function of the components before moving on to final production.

6. **Iteration:** Based on the results of your prototyping, you may need to iterate on your design. This could involve making changes to improve the fit, function, or aesthetics of the components.

Remember, this is just a general guideline. The specific steps and tools you use will depend on your CAD software and the specific requirements of your hardware.
