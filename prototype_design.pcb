# Prototype PCB Design Outline

1. **Import the Schematic:** Start by importing the circuit_design.sch file into your PCB design software. This will automatically generate a rough layout of your PCB with all the components and connections from your schematic.

2. **Arrange the Components:** Move the components around on the board to create a logical and efficient layout. Try to minimize the length of traces and avoid crossing them as much as possible.

3. **Route the Traces:** Connect the components according to the schematic by drawing traces on the board. You may need to use multiple layers and vias to route all the connections.

4. **Add Text and Graphics:** Add any necessary text and graphics to the board, such as labels for connectors, a logo, or a board version number.

5. **Check the Design:** Use the design rule check (DRC) feature of your PCB design software to check for errors like missing connections or traces that are too close together.

6. **Generate the Gerber Files:** Once you're satisfied with your design, generate the Gerber files. These are the files that a PCB manufacturer will use to produce your board.

Remember, this is just a general guideline. The specific steps and tools you use will depend on your PCB design software and the specific requirements of your hardware.
